        <h2>Know The Word </h2>
        <p>Know The Word is a freelance bible quiz application job I've been working on of late and its an application that promises to be interesting (both from the developer perspective and also the user perspective).
      One of the things that makes it interesting is that its my first religious app development experience and also my first windows based application development experience.
  I will post more information as soon as I'm through with the application. </p>
